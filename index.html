<h1>
This is <em> still </em> a motherfucking website. <br>
</h1>
<p>
And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's. <br>
</p>
<h2>
Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit. <br>
</h2>
<p>
<strong> 7 fucking declarations. </strong> <br>
</p>
<p>
That's how much CSS it took to turn that grotesque pile of shit nto this easy-to-read <br>
masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass <br>
website: <br>
</p>
<p>
<strong> And guess what, motherfucker: </strong> <br>
</p>
<p>
You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how. <br>
</p>
<h2>
Let it breathe <br>
</h2>
<p>
Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>
line-height: 1.4 </code>
for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off. <br>
</p>
